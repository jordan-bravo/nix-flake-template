# Nix Flake Template

Template to initate a flake with only the `cowsay` and `hello` packages.  This improves upon the one generated by `nix flake init` by being compatible with all available architectures.

## Usage

1. In the directory of your project, run:

```
nix flake init --template github:jordan-bravo/nix-flake-template
```

2. Edit `flake.nix` and replace `cowsay` and `hello` with your desired packages.  Separate multiple package names with spaces or new lines.

A good way to search for packages is [https://search.nixos.org](https://search.nixos.org)

The `shellHook` section is for any shell commands or variables to be set when the development shell starts.

3. Run the command:
```
nix develop
```

and it will run a shell with the specified packages available and shell variables populated.

Run `exit` to leave the development shell.
